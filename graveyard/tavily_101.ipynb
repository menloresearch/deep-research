Each new modality—whether visual, auditory, spatial, or yet-to-be-defined—should be able to join the framework organically, enriching the whole while benefiting from its connections.\\n\\nRather than defining intelligence by a limited set of preordained capabilities, we aim to construct a platform where novel models can emerge and co-evolve over time, unlocking unforeseen generalization abilities and creative potential.\\n\\n⚙️ Core Pillars of Our Intelligence Framework\\n\\n1. Foundational Modalities\\n\\nThese represent the primary building blocks of our current model and are essential for real-world competency:\\n\\n2. Action & Agency\\n\\nTrue intelligence is not passive—it must act and adapt. We focus on tightly coupling perception with actionable outcomes through:\\n\\n3. Extensible Architecture for New Modalities\\n\\nOur long-term advantage lies in our ability to grow beyond today’s known modalities. The world is represented in a much richer context than simply text or images. Here are some unique modalities that demonstrate the breadth of intelligence representation:\\n\\nThis diversity of modalities highlights why any true Intelligence system must be designed for continuous expansion and integration of new forms of perception and understanding.\\n\\n🔄 Strategic Approach: Lean, Modular, and Principles-Driven\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Why Monolithic Architectures Are Not Feasible and Why Modality Expansion Is Important\\n\\nOver the past few years, the most successful attempts at overcoming challenges in General Intelligence have focused on growing the modality of pretrained models. The core argument is that we need to leverage “pre-train” data to enhance the model’s ability to generalize beyond its original domain.\\n\\nFor many years, research in AI has been hindered by the extreme lack of data sources. Many startups and companies have been founded—and have failed—simply to “make a tool” for data collection.\\n\\nWe strongly believe that Open, General Intelligence should focus on expanding modalities and utilizing pretrained efforts. Only in this way can Open Intelligence truly be open, because efforts will build upon each other rather than being isolated, one-shot attempts.\\n\\n2. Iterative Exploration with Resource Constraints\\n\\nTo stay lean, we prioritize research that maximizes value from minimal inputs, i.e.,\\n\\n📈 Outlook: Growing Toward General Intelligence\\n\\nBy designing intelligence as a growing constellation of interdependent modalities, we transition from rigid, predefined systems to more flexible, adaptive, and ultimately more powerful solutions.\\n\\nIn this future:\\n\\nOur R&D effort isn’t about ticking off familiar modalities; it’s about building the infrastructure to support perpetual evolution. In doing so, we position ourselves not only to meet today’s challenges but to lead the next wave of breakthroughs in open-ended multimodal intelligence.\\n\\nThe Soul of a New Machine\\n\\nSubscribe to our newsletter on AI research.\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nModels\\n\\nInfra\\n\\nCommunity\\n\\n\",\n",

    "      \"raw_content\": \"On This Page\\n\\nBlog Author:\\n\\nResearch Authors:\\n\\nPublished April 9, 2025\\n\\nAlphaSpace: A Step Closer to Having Clumsyless Robots\\n\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) handle text with impressive fluency, but ask one to guide a robot in\\nstacking blocks and see what happens. Bridging the gap between language understanding and physical,\\nspatial action still poses a significant hurdle. To address this, our research team at Menlo—Alan\\nDao (Gia Tuan Dao), Dinh Bach Vu, and Bui Quang Huy—developed AlphaSpace, a methodology aimed at\\nteaching existing models the nuances of navigating and manipulating objectswithin three-dimensional\\nspace via a specialized tokenization approach.\\n\\nWhat is AlphaSpace?\\n\\nThink of AlphaSpace as a spatial reasoning bootcamp for LLMs. It’s a set of techniques to help models\\nunderstand and manipulate objects in three dimensions. The goal isn’t to build a new model from scratch,\\nbut to enhance the ones we have while focusing on practical tasks like picking up, moving, or stacking\\nobjects — the kinds of skills that will be crucial for the robots that one day will tidy our homes\\nor assemble our ikea furniture.\\n\\nThis approach moves beyond understanding language as we or LLMs do, it sits between symbolic\\nrepresentation and physical action, enabling models to operate outside of digital constraints. We\\nwant to enable the translation of a command like “put the red cube on the blue one” (as shown below)\\ninto a series of precise movements in a real (or simulated) space.\\n\\nHow Does It Work?\\n\\nAlphaSpace’s secret sauce is a technique called semantic tokenization, which translates the details\\nof 3D space—an object’s shape, color, position (x, y coordinates), and even its height\\n(z-coordinate)—into a structured text format that LLMs can digest. Imagine describing a “red apple\\nat position (30, 40) with height 5” entirely through these specialized tokens. The model doesn’t “see”\\nthe apple, but it can reason about its properties and location based on the description provided.\\n\\nThis tokenization is hierarchical, and captures both broad locations (coarse grid) and precise spots\\n(fine grid). This structured approach allows the LLM to “see” through text, bypassing the need for\\ncomplex visual processing systems like traditional vision-language models often use.\\n\\nOnce the spatial scene is tokenized, the LLM undergoes a two-step training process, building on the\\nfoundation laid by our earlier work on AlphaMaze  for maze navigation. First,\\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) teaches the model the basics using a dataset of examples containing tokenized\\nscenes paired with the correct sequence of actions. Then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement\\nlearning technique, refines the model’s decision-making. This stage is where the model learns from\\ntrial and error, from within the safety of the simulated environment, to optimize its strategy for\\nbetter performance and enhanced spatial reasoning. Although GRPO was key in AlphaMaze, the current\\nAlphaSpace implementation primarily focused on SFT using synthetic reasoning data.\\n\\nPerformance and Impact\\n\\nOur researchers pitted AlphaSpace against other models using EmbodiedBench, a standard test for AI on handling\\nphysical tasks. The results were quite promising. AlphaSpace aced 10 out of 12 picking tasks and\\nmanaged 6 out of 12 stacking tasks, the performance of other models can be seen on the table below.\\nThis performance boost highlights the advantage of AlphaSpace’s structured, semantics-based approach\\ncompared to models relying more heavily on general vision-language understanding, which seem to\\nstruggle more with the nitty-gritty of precise manipulation.\\n\\nModel | Picking | Stacking | Total Accuracy (%)\\nAlphaSpace (Ours) | 10/12 | 6/12 | 66.67\\nGPT-4o | 6/12 | 3/12 | 37.5\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet | 5/12 | 2/12 | 29.17\\nWe think AlphaSpace is a tangible step towards models that can meaningfully interact with the\\nphysical world. The potential applications are broad, from more capable domestic robots and\\nsmarter warehouse automation to more intuitive interfaces for augmented reality or even more\\nautonomous video game characters (imagine an unbounded NPC 🤔).\\n\\nThe success this experiment underscores the power of symbolic reasoning and structured spatial\\nrepresentation for specific manipulation tasks, offering a different, potentially more efficient path\\nthan compute-heavy vision-centric models for certain applications. It suggests that sometimes,\\ntranslating the world into the right “language” is more effective than trying to make the model see it directly.\\n\\nLooking Ahead\\n\\nWhile the benchmark results are encouraging, AlphaSpace is still learning to walk, let alone run, in\\nthe real world. The current methodology shines in controlled, simulated environments with clearly\\ndefined objects and tasks. Adapting it to the chaos of dynamic, unpredictable real-world settings—where\\nobjects move, lighting changes, and unexpected obstacles appear is the next major hurdle.\\n\\nResearch is ongoing to make AlphaSpace more robust and adaptable. Exploring hybrid models that combine\\nAlphaSpace’s symbolic strengths with lightweight visual processing, or integrating reinforcement learning\\nfor real-time adaptation, are promising directions. Scaling its capabilities to handle more complex\\nsequences of actions, multi-robot collaboration, or tasks involving object rotation also remains future work.\\n\\nFurthermore, the initial project scope was narrowed, focusing on only two types of manipulation tasks\\n(picking and stacking) from the benchmark suite, leaving other spatial challenges unevaluated. More\\ncomprehensive testing is needed to fully map its strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAlphaSpace isn’t grabbing the full potential of LLM applications in the robotics and AI space yet, but it\\nis a step in the right direction. As a methodology, it shows that by cleverly translating 3D space into a\\ntoken LLMs understand and combining this with targeted training, we can imbue these models with\\nsurprisingly effective spatial reasoning skills for manipulation. Its strong benchmark performance,\\nparticularly against leading generalist models, highlights the potential of specialized, structure-aware\\napproaches. By focusing on symbolic representation and reasoning, AlphaSpace offers a lightweight yet powerful\\npathway towards models that can not only talk the talk but also walk the walk—or at least, stack the block\\ncorrectly. The journey to fully embodied AI is long, but AlphaSpace offers a helping hand.\\n\\nHere are some resources additional resouces to learn more about AlphaSpace:\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nWe would like to acknowledge the creators of the DeepSeek and Qwen models for providing the foundation\\nfor our work.

As part of the process, we’ve run some benchmarks, to see how TensorRT-LLM fares on consumer hardware (e.g. 4090s , 3090s ) we commonly see in the Jan’s hardware community .\\n\\nGive it a try! Jan’s TensorRT-LLM extension is available in Jan v0.4.9 and up (see more). We precompiled some TensorRT-LLM models for you to try: Mistral 7b, TinyLlama-1.1b, TinyJensen-1.1b 😂\\n\\nMistral 7b\\n\\nTinyLlama-1.1b\\n\\nTinyJensen-1.1b\\n\\nBugs or feedback? Let us know on GitHub  or via Discord .\\n\\nAn interesting aside: Jan actually started out in June 2023 building on\\nNVIDIA FastTransformer , the\\nprecursor library to TensorRT-LLM. TensorRT-LLM was released in September\\n2023, making it a very young library. We’re excited to see its roadmap\\ndevelop!\\n\\nKey Findings\\n\\n\\n\\nTensorRT-LLM was:\\n\\nWhy TensorRT-LLM?\\n\\nTensorRT-LLM  is Nvidia’s open-source inference library that incorporates Nvidia’s proprietary optimizations beyond the open-source cuBLAS  library.\\n\\nAs compared to llama.cpp , which today dominates Desktop AI as a cross-platform inference engine, TensorRT-LLM is highly optimized for Nvidia GPUs. While llama.cpp compiles models into a single, generalizable CUDA “backend”  that can run on a wide range of Nvidia GPUs, TensorRT-LLM compiles models into a GPU-specific execution graph  that is highly optimized for that specific GPU’s Tensor Cores, CUDA cores, VRAM and memory bandwidth.\\n\\nTensorRT-LLM is typically used in datacenter-grade GPUs, where it produces a face-melting 10,000 tokens/s  on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs . We were curious for how TensorRT-LLM performs on consumer-grade GPUs, and gave it a spin.\\n\\nLlama.cpp | TensorRT-LLM\\nBaseline | Blazing fast (30-70% faster)\\nCompile once, run cross-platform | Compiled and highly optimized for specific GPU architecture\\nGeneralizable and Portable | Highly-optimized\\nModel compiles tosingle, generalizable CUDA “backend” | Model compiles toGPU-specific execution graph\\nExperiment Setup\\n\\nWe ran the experiment using standardized inference requests in a sandboxed environment:\\n\\nint4\\n\\nbatch_size 1\\n\\ninput_len 2048\\n\\noutput_len 512\\n\\nnvidia-smi\\n\\nWe picked a batch size of\\n1 \\nto simulate realistic real-world use cases, as Jan users are likely to make\\none inference request at a time. We also used a input_len of 2048 and\\noutput_len of 512 to simulate a typical chatbot use case.\\n\\ninput_len\\n\\noutput_len\\n\\nFurther Research: We found GPU VRAM Utilization to be difficult to\\nmeasure, with nvidia-smi on Windows producing a different result from\\nWindows Task Manager’s Resource Monitor for NVIDIA GPUs.

It has a ~1000 GB/s memory bandwidth within VRAM, and a PCIe4 x16 lane (~32 GB/s) between the GPU and the CPU.\\n\\nMetrics | GGUF (using CPU) | GGUF (using GPU) | TensorRT-LLM | How TensorRT-LLM Compares\\nThroughput (token/s) | 14.0 | 100.43 | 170.63 | ✅ 69.89% faster\\nMax GPU Utilization (%) | N/A | 83.50 | 88.50 | 5.99% more\\nMax VRAM Utilization (%) | N/A | 64 | 72.1 | 12.66% more\\nAvg RAM Used (GB) | 0.611 | 7.105 | 4.98 | ✅ 29.88% less\\nDisk Size (GB) | 4.07 | 4.06 | 3.05 | ✅ 24.88% smaller\\nTensorRT-LLM was almost 70% faster than llama.cpp by building the model for the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU’s Ada architecture for optimal graph execution, fully utilizing the 512 Tensor Cores, 16,384 CUDA cores, and 1,000 GB/s of memory bandwidth.\\n\\nThe intuition for why llama.cpp is slower is because it compiles a model into a single, generalizable CUDA “backend”  that can run on many NVIDIA GPUs. Doing so requires llama.cpp to sacrifice all the optimizations that TensorRT-LLM makes with its compilation to a GPU-specific execution graph.\\n\\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU\\n\\nOur 3090 Machine, now used by one of our engineers to build Jan\\n\\nHardware Details\\n\\nModel Details\\n\\nThe NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090  is a popular desktop GPU, and retails for approximately $1,500 (as of April 24). It uses the NVIDIA Ampere architecture. As compared to its successor GeForce RTX 4090, it has 33% fewer CUDA cores (10,496) and Tensor Cores (328) and 7% less memory bandwidth (~930 GB/s).\\n\\nMetrics | GGUF (using CPU) | GGUF (using GPU) | TensorRT-LLM | How TensorRT-LLM Compares\\nThroughput (token/s) | 11.42 | 88.70 | 144.19 | ✅ 62.57% faster\\nMax GPU Utilization (%) | N/A | 80.40 | 89.10 | 10.82% more\\nMax VRAM Utilization (%) | N/A | 66.80 | 76.20 | 14.07% more\\nAvg RAM Used (GB) | 0.611 | 2.60 | 0.98 | 62.41%% less\\nDisk Size (GB) | 4.07 | 4.06 | 3.05 | ✅ 24.88% smaller\\nInterestingly, the GeForce RTX 3090 was only 16.6% slower compared with the GeForce RTX 4090. On TPS, TensorRT-LLM outperformed llama.cpp by 62.57%. Curiously, it also used negligible RAM for subsequent inference requests after the initial model warmup.\\n\\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU\\n\\n\\n\\nHardware Details\\n\\nModel Details\\n\\nQ4_K_M\\n\\nWe also benchmarked an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU with 8gb of VRAM, which is a popular configuration among Jan users. Laptop GPUs are less powerful than their desktop counterparts, as they trade portability for reduced energy consumption and thermal constraints.\\n\\nMetrics | GGUF (using CPU) | GGUF (using GPU) | TensorRT-LLM | Difference on GPU\\nThroughput (token/s) | 11.57 | 39.70 | 51.57 | ✅ 29.9% faster\\nMax GPU Utilization (%) | N/A | 80.00 | 84.67 | 5.83% more\\nMax VRAM Utilization (%) | N/A | 72.78 | 81.22 | 11.60% more\\nAvg RAM Used (GB) | 4.49 | 4.44 | 1.04 | ✅ 76.55%% less\\nDisk Size (GB) | 4.07 | 4.06 | 3.05 | ✅ 24.88% smaller\\nTensorRT-LLM on the laptop dGPU was 29.9% faster in tokens per second throughput than llama.cpp, but significantly slower than the desktop GPUs.\\n\\nThe intuition for this is fairly simple: the GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU has 53.1% fewer CUDA cores and Tensor Cores (compared to the 4090), and less VRAM (8gb vs. 24gb). This reduces the surface area for GPU-specific optimizations for TensorRT-LLM.\\n\\nThe GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU is also ~70% slower than the GeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU, showing the hardware effect of less electricity draw, less VRAM, and thermal constraints on inference speed.\\n\\nLaptop with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 eGPU\\n\\n\\n\\nHardware Details\\n\\nModel Details\\n\\nQ4_K_M\\n\\nOur last benchmark was to experiment with an Asus RTX 4090 eGPU , that was connected via a Thunderbolt 3 port  to the Razer Blade 14’s USB4 port . Theoretically, the results should be fairly similar to the GeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU as they have identical underlying GPUs, but with very different connection speeds.\\n\\nWe thought it would be an interesting to see how TensorRT-LLM handles a 68.4% reduction in communication bandwidth between the CPU and GPU:\\n\\nHelp Needed: We are actually not 100% sure what the actual Connection\\nSpeed is between Thunderbolt 3 to\\nUSB4 , as\\nthe actual speed seems different from the advertised speed of 5 GB/s. There\\nseem to be a lot of factors involved, including the actual cable itself. We’d\\nlove if someone in the community can guide us!\\n\\nOverall, we used mid-to-high-end NVIDIA desktop GPUs for our tests, as TensorRT-LLM’s performance enhancements are most apparent on bigger VRAMs. For users with lower-spec machines, llama.cpp is better.\\n\\nMetrics | GGUF (using CPU) | GGUF (using GPU) | TensorRT-LLM | Difference on GPU\\nThroughput (token/s) | 11.56 | 62.22 | 104.95 | ✅ 68.66% faster\\nMax VRAM Utilization (%) | 0 | 65 | 99 | 52.31% more\\nRAM Used (GB) | 0.611 | 5.38 | 4.11 | ✅ 23.61% less\\nDisk Size (GB) | 4.07 | 4.06 | 3.05 | ✅ 24.88% smaller\\nThe Thunderbolt 3 eGPU had a 38.5% lower tokens/s as compared to the PCIe4.0 x16 connected GPU. But the % speedup vs. llama.cpp was similar, at around 69%.\\n\\nInterestingly, the VRAM used with the eGPU was variably higher. Our hypothesis is that the slower communication bandwidth results in more VRAM being allocated, as memory is released mostly slowly as well.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nToken Speed\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughput (Higher is Better) | TensorRT-LLM | Llama.cpp | % Difference\\nGeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU | ✅ 170.63t/s | 100.43t/s | 69.89% faster\\nGeForce RTX 3090 desktop GPU | ✅ 144.19t/s | 88.70t/s | 62.57% faster\\nGeForce RTX 4090 eGPU | ✅ 104.95t/s | 62.22t/s | 68.66% faster\\nGeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU | ✅ 51.57t/s | 39.70t/s | 29.90% faster\\nLaptop AMD Ryzen™ 9 8945HS, 8C/16T | (Not supported) | ✅ 11.57t/s | \\nMax VRAM Utilization\\n\\nAverage VRAM utilization % | TensorRT-LLM | Llama.cpp | % Difference\\nGeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU | 72.10 | 64.00 | 12.66% more\\nGeForce RTX 3090 desktop GPU | 76.20 | 66.80 | 14.07% more\\nGeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU | 81.22 | 72.78 | 11.06% more\\nGeForce RTX 4090 eGPU | N/A | N/A | N/A\\nAWQ INT4\\n\\nq4_k_m\\n\\nMax RAM Usage\\n\\nMax RAM utilization | TensorRT-LLM | Llama.cpp | % Difference\\nGeForce RTX 4090 desktop GPU | ✅ 4.98 | 7.11 | ✅ 29.88% less\\nGeForce RTX 3090 desktop GPU | ✅ 0.98 | 2.60 | ✅ 62.41% less\\nGeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU | ✅ 1.04 | 4.44 | ✅ 76.55%% less\\nGeForce RTX 4090 eGPU | ✅ 4.11 | 5.38 | ✅ 23.61% less\\nTensorRT-LLM uses a lot less Max RAM vs. llama.cpp on slower connection (PCIe 3.0 or Thunderbolt 3) due to better memory management and efficient delegation to VRAM.

We evaluated over a dozen tools (llmperf , psutil , gpustat , native utilities, and more) and found that everyone measures TPS, common metrics differently.

While we observed some transitivity between the LLM’s text and new audio tokens, there were imminent limitations like the lack of generalization to non-synthetic voices, among other issues .\\n\\nFig 1. our previous acoustic tokens early-fusion experiment\\n\\nFig 2: the current approach is early-fusion with semantic tokens\\n\\nFor llama3-s v0.2, we adapted llama3.1 using early-fusion with semantic tokens, inspired by community feedback  [fig 2]. Our goal is to leverage the benefits of semantic tokens, such as simplicity, better compression, and consistent speech-feature extraction, as demonstrated by WhisperVQ . We can always scale up to a hybrid approach and reintroduce acoustic features as needed, given more data and compute resources.\\n\\nYou can learn more about our comparison of semantic and acoustic tokens here.\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nStage 1: pre-training on real speech\\n\\nWe found it useful to pre-train llama3.1 on continuous speech, through rough ablation experimentation. This enhanced llama3’s ability to generalize across semantic tokens.\\n\\nData: We used the MLS-10k dataset  (10 hours of unlabeled, multilingual human speech courtesy of OpenSLR) to pre-train llama3.1 8b on next token prediction (code here ).\\n\\n\\n\\nTraining: The pretraining totaled 5k steps and took over 30 hours*. We used Torchtune’s  fully sharded data parallels, an AdamW Fused optimizer, along with the following parameters:\\n\\nParameter | Continual Training\\nEpoch | 1\\nGlobal batch size | 80\\nLearning Rate | 2e-4\\nLearning Scheduler | LambdaLR with warmup\\nOptimizer | AdamW Fused\\nWarmup Steps | 20\\nWeight Decay | 0.01\\nGradient Checkpointing | Full\\nMax length | 512\\nPrecision | bf16\\nThe learning rate schedule is as follows, starting with a relatively high LR for sufficient warmup.\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss: After 5000 steps, loss converged at just below 2, at which point we simply moved onto the next stage.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompute: We used a single 10x RTX A6000 node to train. We actually own and operate our own A6000’s node that we’ve fondly named “Boba”. So, to get a rough cost calculation for this stage, let us assume a higher end rate of USD0.80 per GPU, totaling $240 for the pre-train.\\n\\n\\n\\nMMLU Eval: We measured MMLU at this stage to get a sense of degradation. 0-shot MMLU dropped from 0.63 → 0.46, a 30% decrease that we hoped to recover in the subsequent stage.\\n\\nStage 2: instruct tuning on a mixture of synthetic data\\n\\nFor the second stage of training, we instruct-tuned llama3 with interleaving synthetic data.\\n\\nData: We use a synthetically generated speech dataset . This speech data is then semantically encoded with WhisperVQ  from WhisperSpeech . This dataset was then interleaved to have 70% speech instruction prompts and 30% speech transcription prompts.\\n\\n\\n\\nTraining:  The instruct tuning was done with fsdp2, mixed-precision, with the final weights in bf16. We used the AdamW Fused optimizer, a global batchsize of 128 (mini-batches of 2-4), a 0.5e-4 LR, and Cosine learning scheduler. You can find the full steps to reproduce our training here .\\n\\nParameter | Continual Training\\nEpoch | 1\\nGlobal batch size | 128\\nLearning Rate | 0.5e-4\\nLearning Scheduler | Cosine with warmup\\nOptimizer | AdamW Fused\\nWarmup Steps | 73\\nWeight Decay | 0.005\\nGradient Checkpointing | Full\\nMax length | 1024\\nPrecision | bf16\\nCompute: The training took place over 32 hours on 8x H100s, spanning 5 epochs at 6 hours & 7261 steps per epoch. At 2.20perH100perhour,weestimatethisruntohavecosted2.20 per H100 per hour, we estimate this run to have costed 2.20perH100perhour,weestimatethisruntohavecosted563, not including several failed runs due to troubleshooting.\\n\\nModel Flops Utilization (MFU) per step is around 20-25% , which is hugely optimizable. It’s also worth mentioning that we intentionally overtrained at this stage to run some grokking  experiments.\\n\\nIn total, both stages of training was achievable under 600,withtheentireexperimentcomingunder600, with the entire experiment coming under 600,withtheentireexperimentcomingunder2800, accounting for various data pipelines and failed runs due to bugs and infrastructure interruptions.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nWe found epoch 3 to be performant and is our current demo checkpoint.\\n\\n\\n\\nAudioBench Eval: AudioBench  is a June 2024 benchmark designed to evaluate audio large language models (AudioLLMs). It measures speech capabilities, in addition to ASR, transcription, etc., through a compilation of many open datasets.\\n\\nModel Bench | Open-hermes Instruction Audio(GPT-4-O judge 0:5) | Alpaca Instruction Audio(GPT-4-O judge 0:5) | Librispeech clean v2(ASR) (WER score)\\nLlama3.1-s-v2-epoch-1 | 3.02 | 2.87 | 94.66%\\nLlama3.1-s-v2-epoch-2 | 3.0 | 3.22 | 60.80%\\nLlama3.1-s-v2-epoch-3 | 3.45 | 3.53 | 49.98%\\nLlama3.1-s-v2-epoch-4 | 3.47 | 2.93 | 60.05%\\nLlama3.1-s-v2-epoch-5 | 3.34 | 3.01 | 69.07%\\nOur training dataset didn’t contain Alpaca Instruction. At epoch 3, llama3-s v.02 achieved an average score of 3.53 on the ALPACA-Audio eval, which seems to beat SALMONN, Qwen-Audio and WavLLM.\\n\\nFig 3: SOTA models evaluated on AudioBench\\n\\nThe overfitting started in epoch 4. It is interesting to observe that OpenHermes-Audio eval remaining high after this epoch, likely indicative of some training data contamination. Thus we are inclined to disregard the OpenHermes-Audio criterion.\\n\\nThis checkpoint is bad at ASR, which wasn’t our target, but we included it for good measure.\\n\\nMMLU eval: Base llama3.1 has an MMLU score of 0.6380, and degrades to the following across our epochs.\\n\\n0.6380\\n\\n | MMLU | Degradation (%)\\nEpoch 1 | 0.5139 | 19.45\\nEpoch 2 | 0.4621 | 27.57\\nEpoch 3 | 0.4676 | 26.71\\nEpoch 4 | 0.4720 | 26.02\\nEpoch 5 | 0.4703 | 26.29\\nNext Steps\\n\\nLlama 3.1 v0.2 is still in its early development and has limitations:\\n\\nAdditionally, our current approach, a Type D.1  multimodal model, has well studied limitations. Namely, there are challenges to scaling the tokenizers and a lack of fine-grained control of how modality information flows in the model. This current approach possibly requires more training data down the road as a tradeoff for its architectural simplicity.\\n\\nFor now, our next steps are as follows:\\n\\nLong term, we aim to develop an open, multi-turn speech model for llama3-s that excels in low-resource languages, with a focus on improving generalization across ASEAN’s diverse accents and dialects. Achieving this will necessitate a significant and sustained data collection effort.\\n\\nAcoustic v Semantic\\n\\ntldr: Acoustic tokens, though more rich in audio features, requires large training data and computational resources.\\n\\nThe loss on our acoustic tokens pre-training were largely stuck at 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere as pretraining on semantic tokens converged to ~1.8 after 7k steps.\\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nOpen Call\\n\\nWe’re calling on LLM researchers and audio experts to experiment with us.\\n\\nJoin the Discord fun:\\n\\nWe believe that collaborative, open research can accelerate progress in this exciting field.

This blog post is a quick project update and an open call to join us in building a speech adapter for open-source models.\\n\\nInspired by the Chameleon  and Llama Herd  papers, llama3-s is an early-fusion, audio and text, multimodal model. We’re conducting this research entirely in the open, with an open-source codebase , open data  and open weights .\\n\\nGradio Demo (19 July 2024): the model “listens” to audio files and does text autocompletion\\n\\nOur initial approach uses a sound compressor to create discrete token representations of sound, which are then used to train the LLM. We hypothesize that these sound tokens can be continuously learned and that existing text-based models can find semantic connections between sound and text representations.\\n\\nIn this post, we share results from a July 19th checkpoint . We trained llama3 8b on synthetic audio, via a small training run that cost less than $600, yielding interesting results. But this is just the beginning, and we need your expertise and ideas to push this research further.\\n\\nImage Credit: When llama learns to listen by Cary & Kumar\\n\\nThe Problem\\n\\nCascaded systems  (currently popular in production) take user speech, transcribe it into text, and pass it into an LLM. They have been proven to be slow, inefficient, and lossy .\\n\\nPictured: Cascaded systems use two separate models. In addition to latency, emotion, tone, many audio features are lost.\\n\\nPictured: Multimodal models natively understand text, audio, image input.\\n\\nSignificant research in this space has been on training multimodal models that natively understand audio tokens and text tokens (see Citations).\\n\\nUsually, this entails pretraining encoders, adapters on large amounts of ASR, AST, synthetic, and human-generated datasets, making the endeavor quite data expensive and compute intensive.\\n\\nWe wanted to see how far we’d get by just continuously training llama3 on a small set of synthetic, high quality instruct QA pairs. Our initial goal is a small, scaling law experiment, where any initial convergence of audio and text tokens could have interesting implications upon larger and more diverse datasets.\\n\\nTraining: 19th July Checkpoint\\n\\nThis experiment ended up being quite achievable on a smaller budgeted run. Building on existing research, we employed a unique combination of techniques. Hopefully our initial findings below contribute meaningful learnings.\\n\\nData: For training data, we collated open datasets, consisting of 6 million (15Bn) Q&A text pairs. This was then reduced to 2Mn instruction pairs (4B tokens) through deduping, and filtering for English (FastText ) and token length. We also used additional heuristics-based classifiers to filter out bad samples for additional quality. (See limitations).\\n\\n\\n\\nFig 1. Data tokens length distribution\\n\\nAudio generation: We then used WhisperSpeech  text-to-speech model on the default voice tensor to generate an interleaving dataset of 2bn tokens (1Mn. wav files):\\n\\nAudio encoding: The Encodec  VQ model was used to tokenized the audio files and create sound tokens, compressing each time step into 2D tensors, via 2 channels (24kHz audio file to 1.5 kps)  These audio tokens were then added to llama3’s existing token vocabulary. (See limitations).\\n\\nYou can find the datasets here:\\n\\nDate | HF Checkpoint | Tokens\\n📅 2024-07-19 | 🔗https://huggingface.co/homebrewltd | 🔢 1.35B\\n📅 2024-07-18 | 🔗https://huggingface.co/datasets/homebrewltd/instruction-speech-v1.55 | 🔢 800M\\n📅 2024-06-30 | 🔗https://huggingface.co/datasets/homebrewltd/instruction-speech-v1 | 🔢 450M\\nTraining: The instruct tuning was done with fsdp2 (Torchtune ) mixed-precision, on a llama3 8b  base model, with the final weights in bf16. We used the AdamMini  optimizer, a global batchsize of 128 (mini-batches of 2-4), a 3e-4 learning rate, and a slightly longer warm up ratio. You can find the full steps to reproduce our training here on Hugging Face .\\n\\n\\n\\nResults: 19 July Run\\n\\nThis checkpoint was evaluated on held-out datasets not overlapping with training data.\\n\\nLoss Evaluation: After 2 billion tokens, the model stablised at a loss of ~1.0.\\n\\nPictured: checkpoint 7-19 loss curve.\\n\\nHeuristics Evaluation: We manually evaluated this checkpoint on 100 samples:\\n\\nA good answer from the checkpoint:\\n\\n# Question (in audio tokens):\\nIs the Paris Climate Change agreement going to help slow pollution?\\n \\n# Expected Output (in text):\\nYes, the Paris Climate Agreement is designed to help slow pollution and combat climate change on a global scale. The main goal of the agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, countries that have signed the agreement commit to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions...\\n \\n# Model's Output (in text):\\nYes, the Paris Climate Agreement is a global commitment to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The agreement was signed by 195 countries and entered into force on November 4, 2016. \\n \\nThe agreement sets out a framework for countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. It also encourages countries to increase their ambition and to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions. \\n \\nThe Paris Agreement is a significant step towards addressing climate change, but it is not a guarantee of success. The agreement requires countries to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) outlining their plans to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The success of the agreement will depend on the ability of countries to meet their NDCs and to work together to address the global nature of climate change.```\\n\\nConversely, a bad answer from the checkpoint:\\n\\n# Question (in audio tokens):\\nwhat is the address to configure a mfm harddrive on a pc without a bios\\n \\n# Expected Output (in text):\\nConfiguring an MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation) hard drive on a PC without a BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a complex task that involves hardware jumpers and possibly some low-level software...\\n \\n# Model's Output (in text):\\nThe average computer memory (RAM) is typically around 4GB, but it can vary depending on the specific model and manufacturer.\\n\\nMany of the bad answers were “sound similar” hallucinations, e.g. the model mishearing Gasoline for Gaslow, which is phonetically similar.\\n\\nGasoline\\n\\nGaslow\\n\\n# Question (in audio tokens):\\nWhy is gasoline a liquid. \\n \\n# Expected Output (in text):\\nGasoline is a liquid because it is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen...\\n \\n# Model's Output (in text):\\nGaslow is a city in Scotland...\\n\\nDegradation Evaluation: We evaluated whether the checkpoint retained original reasoning with 0 shot MMLU.\\n\\nGroups | Version | Original | New | Stderr\\nmmlu | 1 | 0.6380 | 0.2478 | 0.0036\\n- humanities | 1 | 0.5785 | 0.2504 | 0.0063\\n- other | 1 | 0.7184 | 0.2530 | 0.0078\\n- social sciences | 1 | 0.7413 | 0.2418 | 0.0077\\n- stem | 1 | 0.5468 | 0.2448 | 0.0076\\nWhile this specific checkpoint demonstrated forgetting, it has since been addressed.

This helps align the model’s distribution more closely with the original multilingual training of the base LLM.\\n\\nFig 1. Synthetic data generation pipeline\\n\\nTokenizer: To accommodate our shift towards a multilingual dataset, we made a change in our tokenizer from English-only checkpoint  to 7 languages checkpoint .\\n\\nTraining: The pre-training totaled 8064 steps and took over 45 hours on 10xA6000s. We used Torchtune’s  Fully Sharded Data Parallels 2 (FSDP2), an AdamW Fused optimizer, along with the following parameters:\\n\\nParameter | Continual Training\\nEpoch | 1\\nGlobal batch size | 480\\nLearning Rate | 2e-4\\nLearning Scheduler | LambdaLR with warmup\\nOptimizer | AdamW Fused\\nWarmup Steps | 50\\nWeight Decay | 0.005\\nMax length | 512\\nPrecision | bf16\\nLoss: Training loss converged to just below 2. This loss convergence pattern is similar to what we observed in our previous run .\\n\\n\\n\\nMMLU Eval: We measured MMLU at this stage to get a sense of degradation. 5-shot MMLU dropped from 0.69  → 0.42 This decrease rate is higher than our previous run.\\n\\nPhase 2: Balancing Original Performance and Speech Modality\\n\\nThis phase focused on recovering the model’s general capabilities while enhancing its speech-related skills\\n\\nAddressing MMLU Performance Drop: The continual pre-training in Phase 1, while necessary for introducing speech capabilities, significantly reduced the model’s original performance. This is a common challenge when retraining a pre-trained model on new vocabulary. Our goal was to recover these capabilities without compromising the newly acquired speech understanding.\\n\\nSpoiler alert: We recovered MMLU performance from 0.42 to 0.63, reducing the degradation rate to approximately 10%.\\n\\nOptimizing Data and Training Strategies\\n\\nData:\\n\\nTranscription token: Previously, we used 513 semantic tokens from WhisperVQ’s codebook, 2 special tokens for sound input boundaries, and 1 special token for transcription tasks. However, we discovered that the transcription token hindered model recovery.\\n\\nOur solution:\\n\\nTest Name | Pretrain Checkpoint | Dataset | SpeechQA data | Instruction-text data | Transcription data | Final MMLU Score\\nTest 1: Early Pretrain Recovery | 3,000 steps | 500k mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | 0.55\\nTest 2: Late Pretrain Recovery | Last | 500k mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | 0.515\\nTest 3: Late Pretrain Recovery with Transcription (With transcription token) | Last | 500k mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0.48\\nTest 4: Extended Late Pretrain Recovery (With transcription prompts) | Last | 1.89M mixed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0.63\\nMixed training data between modalities: We determined an optimal interleaving of different data types with 70% speech instruction prompts, 20% speech transcription prompts and 10% text-only prompts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis distribution was not arrived at arbitrarily. We conducted several permutation tests to find the sweet spot that balances speech understanding, transcription abilities, and general language skills.\\n\\nTraining: The phase 2 training totaled 7400 steps and took over 10 hours on 8xH100s with the following parameters:\\n\\nParameter | Continual Training\\nEpoch | 1\\nGlobal batch size | 256\\nLearning Rate | 7e-5\\nLearning Scheduler | LambdaLR with warmup\\nOptimizer | AdamW Fused\\nWarmup Steps | 73\\nWeight Decay | 0.005\\nMax length | 4096\\nPrecision | bf16\\nLoss: Training loss converged at 1.08\\n\\n\\n\\nPhase 3: Teach Ichigo To Say “I cannot hear”\\n\\nIn this final phase, we focused on fine-tuning the model to improve user interaction, particularly in handling inaudible inputs and multi-turn conversations.\\n\\nObjectives\\n\\nTeach model to say “I cannot hear”\\n\\nOur initial approach was to create a synthetic dataset of random environmental noises. However, we quickly realized that this method was difficult to scale.\\n\\nTo fix this problem, we hypothesized that meaningful speech typically follows certain patterns. This led us to utilize the 513 sound tokens from the WhisperVQ codebook, and randomize them into similar patterned sequences. This method allowed us to generate a vast amount of “inaudible” input data with a wide distribution. The key insight was that if the model could recognize these chaotic patterns as inaudible input, it would learn to decline responses appropriately.\\n\\nInaudible space is much larger than Speech space\\n\\nTo put this in perspective: With an average speech input of about 50 sound tokens, there are 513^50 possible arrangements. However, only a tiny fraction of these arrangements would constitute meaningful speech. By exposing our model to a wide range of these chaotic arrangements, we taught it to distinguish between audible and inaudible inputs effectively.\\n\\nData:\\n\\nMulti-turn Conversation:\\n\\nTo enhance multi-turn capabilities with speech input, we fine-tuned the model using 150K samples. The dataset composition was:\\n\\n\\n\\nInaudible Refusal data:\\n\\nFor the inaudible inputs, we employed the Qwen2.5-72B model  to generate diverse synthetic answers. This process was facilitated through Distillabel , ensuring a wide range of appropriate “decline” responses.\\n\\nBeyond randomizing sound tokens for inaudible input, we also performed sequence length distribution matching between inaudible and audible data. This ensured a balanced representation of both types of inputs in our training set.\\n\\nTraining: The phase 3 training totaled 644 steps and took over 3 hours on 8xH100s with the following parameters:\\n\\nParameter | Continual Training\\nEpoch | 1\\nGlobal batch size | 256\\nLearning Rate | 1.5e-5\\nLearning Scheduler | LambdaLR with warmup\\nOptimizer | AdamW Fused\\nWarmup Steps | 8\\nWeight Decay | 0.005\\nMax length | 4096\\nPrecision | bf16\\nLoss: Loss converged at 0.98\\n\\n\\n\\nResults\\n\\nMMLU: We recovered the MMLU after phase 1 and maintained the instruct following performance after phase 3\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know that with only MMLU is insufficient to claim recovery.

It tackles maze puzzles—tasks that humans solve intuitively but LLMs typically fail—through targeted visual decoding techniques.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nRecent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a fascinating concept: giving models time to think dramatically improves their performance. These “reasoning” models, as they’re often called, have achieved remarkable results on complex mathematical benchmarks like AIME  and MATH . This success isn’t limited to massive models like O3-mini and Deepseek-r1; the community has also achieved strong results by fine-tuning smaller, “distilled” models, such as 1.5b  and 7b  versions.\\n\\nThe core algorithm driving much of this progress is GRPO  (Group Relative Policy Optimization). GRPO is an online learning method, meaning it constantly refines the model using data generated during the training process itself. It’s a powerful way to iteratively improve performance.\\n\\nHowever, while these reasoning models excel in text-based tasks like solving mathematical problems, they often struggle with tasks that require visual understanding. For example, benchmarks like ARC-AGI, which involve visual reasoning, remain challenging for these models, even though they might seem straightforward to a human.\\n\\nInspired by the spirit of the ARC-AGI test, we train the model on a maze-solving task—something intuitive for humans but challenging for AI. Our goal is to enhance the visual reasoning capabilities of AI by focusing on a task that requires spatial understanding and step-by-step problem-solving.\\n\\nDemo\\n\\nThe video demonstrates AlphaMaze’s process: inputting a maze, the model will reason through and output of the most likely direction.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nPrior research, such as Microsoft’s “Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT) ”, has shown that models can solve image-based mazes by generating visual representations of their reasoning process. However, these models still have limitations in their ability to create accurate visual representations and are often evaluated using multiple-choice question (MCQ) setups, which may not fully capture their reasoning abilities.\\n\\nAlphaMaze takes a different approach. We built our model on a distilled, 1.5-billion parameter Qwen model  (based on Deepseek-R1), and trained it to solve mazes presented in a text-based format. Our core hypothesis is that if a model can successfully reconstruct a maze from a text description and use that internal representation to plan its next move, it demonstrates a form of visual reasoning.\\n\\nNormal LLM\\n\\n\\n\\nGPT-4o  and Qwen-Max  failed on solving a maze.\\n\\nCurrent language models exhibit consistent limitations in maze navigation tasks, indicating a gap in spatial reasoning capabilities.\\n\\nAlphaMaze\\n\\n\\n\\nVisualization of AlphaMaze’s step-by-step reasoning process while solving a maze. Each step shows the model’s thought process and directional decision.\\n\\nCorrect answer: <|down|><|left|><|left|><|down|><|right|><|right|><|right|>\\n\\n<|down|><|left|><|left|><|down|><|right|><|right|><|right|>\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nOur training process involved two key stages: creating a specialized dataset and then using a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to train the model.\\n\\nCreating the Maze Dataset\\n\\nTo train a model to reason about mazes, we needed a large and diverse dataset of mazes.  We leveraged the excellent maze-dataset framework  from Understanding Search, which generates 5x5 mazes using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. This provided us with a solid foundation of varied maze layouts.\\n\\nHowever, we needed to transform these mazes into a format that our language model could understand.  This is where our token-based representation system comes in.  Think of it as translating the visual structure of the maze into a “language” the model can process.\\n\\nHere’s how we broke it down:\\n\\nSpatial relationships are encoded through a token system: <row-col> for coordinates, directional markers for walls, and <up>, <down>, <left>, <right> for movements.\\n\\n<row-col>\\n\\n<up>\\n\\n<down>\\n\\n<left>\\n\\n<right>\\n\\nThe key innovation is our token system. We use special tokens to represent:\\n\\n<row-col>\\n\\n<0-0>\\n\\n<2-4>\\n\\n<no_wall>\\n\\n<up_wall>\\n\\n<down_wall>\\n\\n<up>\\n\\n<down>\\n\\n<left>\\n\\n<right>\\n\\n<origin>\\n\\n<target>\\n\\nThis system enables us to generate step-by-step navigation sequences, where each step captures the entire maze state along with a single directional indicator. This structured representation makes it well-suited for training models to reason about movement and spatial decision-making.\\n\\nAs a result, we have compiled a dataset of 100,000 maze examples, available here: Maze-Reasoning Dataset .\\n\\nImplementation Details:\\n\\nThe token generation process is essentially a conversion of the maze structure into a carefully ordered sequence of these tokens. This sequence provides a complete, step-by-step representation of the maze, suitable for training models on visual reasoning and pathfinding tasks.\\n\\nStage 1: Supervised Fine-Tuning\\n\\nGoals:\\n\\nMethodology:\\n\\nWe explored two approaches:\\n\\nSFT Hyperparameters:\\n\\nTraining data: 500,000 samples (filter out samples have over 4096 tokens).\\n\\nParameter | Value\\nmodel_name_or_path | deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\\ndisable_gradient_checkpointing | true\\nfinetuning_type | full\\ndeepspeed | ds0\\ncutoff_len | 4096\\ntrain_on_prompt | true\\nper_device_train_batch_size | 32\\ngradient_accumulation_steps | 1\\nlearning_rate | 1.0e-5\\nnum_train_epochs | 1.0\\nlr_scheduler_type | cosine\\nwarmup_ratio | 0.1\\nbf16 | true\\nmodel_name_or_path\\n\\ndeepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\\n\\ndisable_gradient_checkpointing\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nfinetuning_type\\n\\nfull\\n\\ndeepspeed\\n\\nds0\\n\\ncutoff_len\\n\\n4096\\n\\ntrain_on_prompt\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nper_device_train_batch_size\\n\\n32\\n\\ngradient_accumulation_steps\\n\\n1\\n\\nlearning_rate\\n\\n1.0e-5\\n\\nnum_train_epochs\\n\\n1.0\\n\\nlr_scheduler_type\\n\\ncosine\\n\\nwarmup_ratio\\n\\n0.1\\n\\nbf16\\n\\ntrue\\n\\nStage 2: Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO\\n\\nAfter SFT, we used GRPO to further refine the model’s maze-solving abilities.  GRPO is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows the model to learn from its own generated solutions, iteratively improving its strategy.\\n\\nConstructing the GRPO Reward Function\\n\\nA crucial aspect of reinforcement learning is the reward function, which guides the model towards desired behaviors. We designed a composite reward function with several components, each focusing on a different aspect of good maze-solving:\\n\\nCorrectness\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nThe reward function implements a dual-weighted system: solution accuracy (2.0) and move validity (0.5), optimizing for both correctness and constraint satisfaction.\\n\\nValidity:\\n\\nValidity\\n\\n<up>\\n\\n<down>\\n\\n<left>\\n\\n<right>\\n\\nStrict Formating:\\n\\nStrict Formating\\n\\n^<think>\\\\n.*?\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\\\n.*?\\\\n$\\n\\n<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nSoft Formating:\\n\\nSoft Formating\\n\\n<think>.*?</think>\\\\s*.*?\\n\\n<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\nTag Formating:\\n\\nTag Formating\\n\\n<think>\\\\n\\n\\n\\\\n</think>\\\\n\\n\\nTotal Reward Calculation:\\n\\nThe final reward is the sum of all these components:\\n\\nTotal Reward = Correctness + Validity + Strict Formating + Soft Formating + Tag Formating\\n\\nMaximum Possible Reward: 2.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 3.75\\n\\nGRPO training hyperameters\\n\\nFor the GRPO training, we configured the following parameters and models:\\n\\nWe use Unsloth framework.\\n\\nParameter | Value\\nlearning_rate | 1e-6\\nalpha | 128\\nr | 128\\nweight_decay | 0.1\\nwarmup_ratio | 0.1\\nlr_scheduler_type | cosine\\noptim | paged_adamw_8bit\\nper_device_train_batch_size | 8\\ngradient_accumulation_steps | 1\\nnum_generations | 4\\nmax_prompt_length | 612\\nmax_completion_length | 4096\\nmax_grad_norm | 0.1\\nResults\\n\\nSFT\\n\\nWe use llama-factory to SFT the model\\nHere’s a summary of the SFT training runs:\\n\\nRun ID | Model Config | Dataset | Steps | Loss | Hardware | Detailed Explanation\\nexp-1 | Full-Finetune | Maze Reasoning | 3125 | 0.01 | ~1.5 hours on 6xA6000s | Added new maze tokens\\nexp-2 | Full-Finetune | Maze Reasoning | 3125 | 0.01 | ~1.5 hours on 6xA6000s | Pure text\\nexp-3 | Full-Finetune | Maze Reasoning | 2344 | 0.0077 | ~12 hours on 6xA6000s | Expanded pure text training\\nexp-4 | Full-Finetune | Maze Reasoning | 2344 | ~0 | ~1.5 hours on 6xA6000s | Expanded pure text training\\nexp-5 | Full-Finetune | Maze Reasoning | 3681 | ~0.02 | ~1 hours on 8xH200s | Added new maze tokens\\nAdding new maze tokens results in poor performance. However, without the additional tokens, the model performed surprisingly well with the same training steps.\\n\\nExperimental results suggest reduced token complexity correlates with improved spatial-to-language translation performance.\\n\\nGRPO\\n\\nFigure below displays the MazeBench scores (blue crosses) over GRPO steps along with a linear regression trendline (red dashed line). The steady increase in the trendline indicates that GRPO effectively guides the model towards improved maze-solving policies.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nImplications\\n\\nThis research demonstrates the potential for enhancing the visual thinking capabilities of language models using a text-based approach.  If a text-based model can successfully reason about and solve mazes, it suggests an internal understanding of spatial relationships and visual concepts.

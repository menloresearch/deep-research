# Deep Research

## Prerequisites

- Python >=3.11
- `uv` (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/menloresearch/deep-research.git
    cd deep-research
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using uv:**

    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e .
    uv pip install -e verifiers-deepresearch
    uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
    ```

## Quick Start

This section provides a quick way to get the main training pipeline running. These steps assume you have completed the "Setup" section above.

1. **Download Data:**
    In a terminal where your virtual environment is activated:

    ```bash
    make download-data
    ```

2. **Start Services (RAG and other backend services):**
    Open a new terminal or tmux session, activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`), and then run:

    ```bash
    # this includes the vllm server, flashrag, sandbox, and mock servers
    make run-all-services-nodocker
    ```

    Keep this terminal running.

3. **Run the Main Training Script:**
    Open a new terminal or tmux session, activate the virtual environment, and then run:

    ```bash
    bash train_grpo.sh
    ```

    (This runs the main GRPO training script on GPU 2 by default. Adjust the script if you want a different GPU.)

## Running Services with Makefile

- Open new terminal or tmux session
- Run `make run-all-services-nodocker` to start all services
- Run `make kill-all-services-nodocker` to stop all services

## Enhanced RAG with Search and Visit Site

This project includes an enhanced RAG system that combines search functionality with the ability to visit specific pages for detailed content. The implementation provides:

### Features

- **Enhanced Search**: Returns search results with URLs and previews
- **Visit Site**: Retrieves full content for specific documents
- **Intelligent Workflow**: Model can preview results before visiting pages

### Usage

The enhanced RAG tools are available in `verifiers-deepresearch/verifiers/tools/search_visit_rag.py`:

```python
from verifiers.tools.search_visit_rag import search_with_urls, visit_site

# Search with previews
results = search_with_urls("machine learning algorithms", num_results=3)

# Visit specific page for full content
content = visit_site("doc_1")
```

### Training with Enhanced RAG

1. **Kill GPU processes and clear memory:**

```bash
make kill-gpus
```

2. **Start vLLM server:**

```bash
make serve-vllm
```

3. **Run training script:**

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4,5,6,7 accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 4 --config_file configs/zero3.json verifiers-deepresearch/verifiers/examples/trl_deepresearch_search_visit_site_offline.py
```

## Data Management

### Download Data from HuggingFace

To download data from HuggingFace, use the following command:

```bash
make download-data
```

This will download the dataset from `janhq/demo-deep-research-data`.

To download the model:

```bash
make download-model
```

This will download the model from `janhq/demo-deep-research-model` (including wandb and tensorboard_logs if available).

### Prepare All Datasets (One time run)

To download and prepare all datasets (Musique and ReCall), run:

```bash
make data
```

This will:

1. Download the Musique dataset
2. Process and prepare the Musique dataset
3. Convert Musique data to ReCall format
4. Download the ReCall syntool dataset
5. Create sampled subsets (1000 train and 50 test examples) of syntool_re_call data

### Prepare Specific Datasets

For more granular control, you can use these commands:

```bash
# Download and prepare only Musique data
make prepare-data

# Download and sample only ReCall syntool data
make download-recall-syntool
```

### Upload Data to HuggingFace

To upload data to HuggingFace, use the following command:

```bash
make upload-data
```

This will upload the `data` directory to `janhq/demo-deep-research-data`.

To upload a model:

```bash
make upload-model
```

This will upload the `data` directory and model-specific directories (wandb, tensorboard_logs) to `janhq/demo-deep-research-model`.

To upload model checkpoints:

```bash
make upload-checkpoint
```

This will upload the `checkpoints` directory to `janhq/demo-deep-research-model`.

To download model checkpoints:

```bash
make download-checkpoint
```

This will download checkpoint files from `janhq/demo-deep-research-model` to the `checkpoints` directory.

Both upload commands require setting the HuggingFace token:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your-token"
```

## Running Services with Docker Compose (Deprecated)

The project uses Docker Compose to manage and run its services, including the retrieval server and any other backend components (e.g., sandbox environment).

To start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (implicitly used by the `Makefile` targets), use:

```bash
make docker-up
```
